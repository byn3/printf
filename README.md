# printf  

## Description  

Created our own printf function. The function should produce an output according to a specified format. The output should be similar to the real printf. There are many formats and features not implemented yet. If conversion specifiers are passed in, use appropriate function.  
There were many project limitations/ restrictions such as can not include some specific libraries or use of some functions.
